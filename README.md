This is a poc for injecting styles at server when ssr is true, so that lcp and other web vitals stays good
Nothing has been done in this, in the nuxt plain starter just enabled ssr and wrote plain vanilla css
Issues were there in primevue and vuetify
So for a smaller project no library approach wil be good i think
